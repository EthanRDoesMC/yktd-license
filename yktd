(project) uses the YKTD License

You can do basically anything with this source code except:

Use it maliciously
Sell it (Don't profit from my work, this isn't retail)
Claim it as yours
Claim you made all of it
[optional] Hold me reliable for issues. ([optional] reason) Do report bugs.

Of course, special conditions can be arranged.
Contact me if you believe both projects would benefit from an exception.

You must include this license if the project you're using included it. 

This license is applied with common sense. If it's a matter of technicalities and loopholes, it doesn't count.
No one wants to sit around and read a long Shakespearian license (A Midsummer Night's Dream is a funny work of his;
watching/reading that would be a better use of your time). Please, just... come on.

You know the drill.
